# odin-recipes
```
This is my first project on The Odin Project: to create a basic recipe page, linked to a few recipes.

End of project observations:

1) Learned to use 'id' attributes to reference link to top of page.
2) Applied alt text to images.
3) Created common stylesheet and linked to it from individual recipe pages.
4) Added several CSS Rules to modify the text.

Note: applying styles causes unexpected outputs with browsers in darkmode.
